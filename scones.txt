Scones Recipe
for the scones:
500g plain flour
17g baking powder
100g caster sugar
Pinch of salt
100g diced butter
250ml milk
for the egg wash:
2 egg yolks
10ml milk
Pinch of sugar
Sieve the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into a bowl.
Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until
it’s well combined. Add the milk and mix well.
Once it starts to come together, turn it out on to a lightly
floured surface and knead gently until it forms a soft,
smooth dough. Wrap in cling film and chill for one hour.
Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a
thickness of 2.5cm and cut into rounds with a 5cm cutter.
Place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Now mix the egg wash ingredients together in a small
bowl and brush the top of each scone, twice.
Bake for 10 minutes until golden brown.
When serving your scones, remember to do it the
Cornish way: the jam first, then the Rodda’s!
